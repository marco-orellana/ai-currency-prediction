	
Goal: AI that will predict how the market is going to move and give you
the next highest high / lowest low , in how much time and a percentage of how accurate it will be.
	
The purpose of this project is to learn new technologies, design patterns, software developpement processes and of course to have fun.
	
The project is going to be separated in four big category:

		AI
			Language: Python
			Technology: Keras or Tensorflow
			Description: Will be the brain, makes and calculate the prediction.
			
		
		Server
			Language: Javascript, TypeScript or Python
			Technology: Express.js or Flask
			Database: MongoDB or PostgreSql
			Description: Will stock the info and data of the ai and is going to have an rest api.
			
			
		Web Client
			Language: TypeScript/Javascript
			Technology: React
			Description: Will display infos and the predictions of the ai.

		Mobile Client
			Language: TypeScript/Javascript. Kotlin or Java
			Technology: React Native, Android Studio
			Description: Will display infos and the predictions of the ai.
			
			
			
Concepts to look / learn:
		Perceptron
		Matrice
		Weight/Bias
		Trading Patterns
		FrameWork Test
		Keras and Tensorflow
